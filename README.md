ðŸ“„ Project Description

    Setting-Panel is a modern React-based Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to customize
    the applicationâ€™s appearance and language preferences based on their needs. The app supports theme toggling,
    language switching, and features a complete cart flow along with a customizable notification system.

ðŸ”„ App Workflow

    On first visit, the app auto-detects the user's system theme and sets the app theme accordingly.
    The default language is English, but users can switch to German at any time via the settings.
    
    A Products page displays a list of static products. 
    Users can:

        - Add items to the cart
        - Remove items from the cart (either via the cart or directly on the products page)

    Authentication Flow:

        - If the user is not signed in, a Sign In button appears on the app bar.
        - Upon signing in, the user's information is displayed.
        - Users can update their profile, including changing their name.

    Notifications:

        - Users receive notifications when interacting with the cart or updating their profile.
        - Notifications can be enabled or disabled from the Profile Page.
        - When notifications are disabled, users wonâ€™t receive any further alerts.

ðŸ§  Core Concepts

    To maintain state consistency across page reloads, the app uses Redux Persist to store and rehydrate Redux state. 
    
    The following user preferences and data are persisted:

        - Theme Mode (Light/Dark)
        - Language Preference
        - Notification Settings
        - Cart Items
        - User Information
